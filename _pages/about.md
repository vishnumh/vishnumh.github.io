Hi, I'm Vishnu M H, a final year graduate student from the College of Engineering at CMU, focusing on Computer Vision. At CMU, I work in the Human Sensing Lab (HSL) at the Robotics Institute, directed by Prof Fernando De La Torre. During my time in HSL, I have explored the domains of 3D Vision and AR Glasses while working on 3D Human Digitization and language-guided Video Summarization. Prior to HSL, I worked in Cylab with Dr Iljo Baek and Prof Raj Rajkumar to deploy and accelerate Computer Vision pipelines related to autonomous driving in Jetson devices.

In my Graduate education, I primarily focus on Deep Learning and Computer Vision, specializing in 3D vision, but with exposure to Parallel Computing Platforms. During my undergraduate education at NIT Trichy, India, I gained domain knowledge in Robotics and Autonomous Systems in both the software and hardware sectors. Additionally, as an undergraduate, I had the privilege of publishing papers in Frontiers in Robotics and AI Journal and IEEE Conferences.
