Hi, I'm Vishnu M H, a final year graduate student from CMU. At CMU, I work in Human Sensing Lab (HSL) directed by Prof Fernando De La Torre, where I have explored in the domains of 3D Vision, AR Glasses while working on 3D Human Digitization and language guided Video Summarization using CLIP models. Prior to HSL, I worked in Cylab with Dr Iljo Baek and Prof Raj Rajkumar for deploying and accelerating Computer Vision pipelines in Jetson devices.

In my Graduate education, I am primarily focusing on Deep Learning and Computer Vision specializing in 3D vision, but with an exposure to Parallel Computing Platforms. During my undergraduate education, I have gained domain knowledge in Robotics and Autonomous Systems in both Software and Hardware sector. Also while in undergrad, I had the privilege of publishing papers in Frontiers in Robotics and AI Journal and IEEE Conferences.
