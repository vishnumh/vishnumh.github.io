Hi, I'm Vishnu M H, a Computer Vision Engineer at Meta. I graduated with a Master's degree from Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), specializing in Computer Vision. At CMU, I worked in the Human Sensing Lab (HSL) at the Robotics Institute, directed by Professor Fernando De La Torre. During my time at HSL, I explored 3D Vision and AR Glasses, focusing on 3D Human Digitization and language-guided Video Summarization. Prior to HSL, I worked in Cylab with Dr. Iljo Baek and Professor Raj Rajkumar, where I deployed and accelerated Computer Vision pipelines related to autonomous driving on Jetson devices.

In my graduate education, I primarily focused on Deep Learning and Computer Vision, specializing in 3D Vision, with additional exposure to Parallel Computing Platforms. During my undergraduate education at NIT Trichy in India, I gained expertise in Robotics and Autonomous Systems, covering both software and hardware aspects. Additionally, as an undergraduate, I had the privilege of publishing papers in the Frontiers in Robotics and AI Journal and IEEE Conferences.
