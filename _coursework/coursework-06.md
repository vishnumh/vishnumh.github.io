● Trained an encoder-decoder architecture for regressing voxels, point clouds and mesh representation from a single view RGB input.<br />
● Implemented Nerf from scratch with Differentiable Renderer for emission-absorption volumes, uniform ray sampler and view dependent MLP with position encoding. <br />
● Created a code base for sphere tracing for rendering Sign Distance Function and trained an ML architecture for neural SDF on point cloud data.
