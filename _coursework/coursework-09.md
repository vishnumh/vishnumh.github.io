Designed a lateral controller using Pole Placement and Model Predictive Control, and a longitudinal control using PID controller for Tesla Model 3 self-driving car. Performed EKF SLAM for estimating the vehicle state variables and deployed the algorithms in a simulator.

Learning Outcomes: 
1. State space representation, similarity transformation, Jordan decomposition. 
2. Controllability/observability, solution of linear equations, SVD.
3. Controllable canonical forms, observable cononical form, MIMO and kalman decomposition.
4. Controller - PID, Pole placement, Model Predictive Control and Adaptive Controls.
5. SLAM - Kalman filter, Extended KF, UKF. 
 
Programming Language:
Python
