● Created scripts to measure latency and Throughput of SIMD addition and FMA.<br />
● Designed a fast matrix multiply kernel in SIMD as the sum of outer product.<br /> 
● Implemented a cache oblivious program for matrix transpose using Morton Z ordering.<br />
● Designed a Cache aware matrix multiplication kernel with L1 and L2  cache as set assciative cache.<br /> 
● Implemented all gather collective communication in MPI.<br />
