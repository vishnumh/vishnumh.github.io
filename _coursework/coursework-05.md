● Created scripts to measure latency and Throughput of SIMD addition and FMA.
● Designed a fast matrix multiply kernel in SIMD as the sum of outer product. 
● Implemented a cache oblivious program for matrix transpose using Morton Z ordering.
● Designed a Cache aware matrix multiplication kernel with L1 and L2  cache as set assciative cache. 
● Implemented all gather collective communication in MPI.
