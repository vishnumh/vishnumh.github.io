● Trained multi-label image classification models for FashionMNIST and PASCAL 2007 datasets.
● Worked on weakly supervised object detection using Robust AlexNet backbone on Pascal dataset and obtained comparable mAP to the supervised networks.
● Deployed GAN network architectures which include LSGAN and WGAN-GP on CUB 2011 Dataset to generate realistic images of birds. 
● Worked on open-ended Visual Question Answering for MSCOCO VQA dataset using simple Bag of Words baseline with GoogleNet feature extractor and Co-attention networks
