● Trained multi-label image classification models for FashionMNIST and PASCAL 2007 datasets.<br />
● Worked on weakly supervised object detection using Robust AlexNet backbone on Pascal dataset and obtained comparable mAP to the supervised networks.<br />
● Deployed GAN network architectures which include LSGAN and WGAN-GP on CUB 2011 Dataset to generate realistic images of birds.<br /> 
● Worked on open-ended Visual Question Answering for MSCOCO VQA dataset using simple Bag of Words baseline with GoogleNet feature extractor and Co-attention networks.<br />
