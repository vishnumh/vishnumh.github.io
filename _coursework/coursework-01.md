● Deployed visual object tracking with Lucas-Kanade forward additive image alignment algorithm and Matthew-Bakers Inverse Compositional alignment algorithm.
● Performed 3-D Reconstruction using bundle adjustment and estimated Fundamental matrix with 8/7-point algorithm and RANSAC.
● Worked on stitching panoramas utilizing homography. Performed OCR from handwritten letters with a CNN model trained on MNIST dataset.
● Implemented the Hough Transform to detect lines in an image.
● Extracted SIFT features to build a Bag-of-Words representation of an image for classification.
