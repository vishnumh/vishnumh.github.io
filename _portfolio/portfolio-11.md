Created scripts for the paper [Gaze-enabled Egocentric Video Summarization via Constrained Submodular Maximization](https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/papers/Xu_Gaze-Enabled_Egocentric_Video_2015_CVPR_paper.pdf) from scratch. Tested out the results in videoes taken from CMU using AR glasses

Learning outcomes: 
1. Basics of CLIP Models and Multimodal ML.
2. Backbone - MRCNN.
3. Optimization Techniques - Submodular Optimization, Mutual Information.
4. Clustering Algorithm - KMeans, Greedy, Temporal Star clustering.

Programming Language:
Python, Pytorch
