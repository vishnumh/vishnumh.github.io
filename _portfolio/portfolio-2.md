Trained a single view implicit functions based human reconstruction model using a 3D human dataset. Extended the work to multi-views using various feature-based fusions and post-fusion techniques. 

Learning outcomes : 
1. Different representations of 3D models like Implicit functions, sine distance function, mesh, point clouds
2. Visualization techniques for implicit functions - Marching cubes
3. 3D Loss functions and accuracy metrics: Chamfer distance, P2S, F1 score

Programming Language:
Pytorch, Python
