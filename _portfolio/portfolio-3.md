Worked on training HRNet using DeepFasion 2D dataset to estimate cloth landmarks in reference images. Used these estimated key points and 3D reconstructed humans from a single view to perform garment parsing.

Learning outcomes: 
1. Orthographic projection models and coordinate systems.
2. Multi-GPU training - Data-Parallel and Distributed Data-Parallel.

Programming Language:
Pytorch, Python
