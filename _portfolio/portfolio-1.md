SMPL is an articulated model to represent under clothed human. SMPLX is an extension of SMPL which includes an articulated expressive models for hands into SMPL. I worked on implementing State of the art models for fitting SMPLX onto reference images and regress COCO 3D keypoints for a downstream task.

Learning outcomes : 
1. Parametric modelling of Pose (55 rotational poses - 22 joints for the body, 30 for finger and 3 jaw joints)
2. Copy-Paste integration for including hand articulated models into SMPL.

Programming Language:
Pytorch, Python
